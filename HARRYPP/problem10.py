# heyy,,, copilot see the quention on the the practice set shown on the screen
#Q3. Can we have a set with 18(int) and "18"(string) as a value?
#ANS: Yes, we can have both 18 (int) and "18" (string) as values in a set because they are of different data types.
s = set()
s.add(18)
s.add("18")
print(s)
